# Deep Learning for Coders

Exercises and questionnaires following the book [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch]() and the 2020 version of the [fastai](https://course.fast.ai) course.

For the exercises, additional examples will be created, instead of executing what you can find in the [Fastbook repo](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook), as the purpose is to see how to apply `PyTorch` and `fastai` in different use cases.

The questionnaires solutions focus on the theoretical questions and give references for further exploration, so not all points can have an answer. The questionnaires are presented as in they appeared in the chapters of the book, which is different to the lessons in the course.
Answers to the questions can be also found in the [Fastai Forum Part 1 v4](https://forums.fast.ai/c/part1-v4/46).
