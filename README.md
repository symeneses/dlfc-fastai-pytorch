# Deep Learning for Coders

Exercises and questionnaires following the 2020 version of the [fastai](https://course.fast.ai) course.

For the exercises, additional examples will be created, instead of executing what you can find in the [Fastbook repo](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook), as my purpose is to see how to apply `PyToch` and `Fastai` in different use cases.

The questionnaires solutions are written with my own words and focuses on the theoretical questions, so not all points can have an answer. Answers to the questions can be found in the [Fastai Forum Part 1 v4](https://forums.fast.ai/c/part1-v4/46).
